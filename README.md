This tool aims to simplify the export file section in Step 4.

## How to use it:
1. Export your model files to `input` folder (if not exist, create one in root folder together with `export.bat`) from Blender (or other softwares);
2. Run `export.bat` and input your new name of the warship part;
3. Wait until it has finished, then you can get all transformed files in `result` folder.
